# Deep Learning Midterm Project, Spring 2024

Training a CNN on CIFAR-10. The work of Ian Adler, Phil Olarte, and David Vaillant.

Instructions: Set up your virtual environment, install the requirements, and run `main.py`. The trainer automatically detects the appropriate device.

If you're running this through a Jupyter notebook, set `USE_PROGRESS_BAR` to False. Checkpoints are saved automatically as training proceeds, and a summary of the training/test loss and accuracies are saved to the `results` subdirectory.

Runs are given names based on the time they start.
